I do alot of work from places with no internet and so I have assembled a bunch of useful things to make this process a hell of alot more easy for me

This includes things like including:

	* Bootstrap
	* Sample Designs for BootStrap
	* jQuery

Things I need to add to this pack:

	* FlatUI
	* Node.js Documentation
	* PHP Documentation
