Dev Pack
===

I do alot of work from places with no internet and so I have assembled a bunch of useful things to make this process a hell of alot more easy for me

This includes things like including:

	* Bootstrap
	* Sample Designs for BootStrap
	* FlatUI
	* jQuery
	* Underscore JS
	* Pics of kittens (Of Varying Size)
	* Go By Example

Things I need to add to this pack (But have not gotten around to it):

	* Node.js Documentation
	* PHP Documentation
	* D3JS (With examples)
	* Unix Tools
	* Micro Commands
	* List of Words
